## My excel project with DSA Incubator in Data Analysis
# Project Overview:Amazon Product Review Analysis
As a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Amazon product and customer review data to extract actionable insights that support product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. The dataset comprised 1,465 Amazon products, including details such as product category, price, discount, ratings, and aggregated customer reviews.

Using Excel tools such as pivot tables, calculated columns, and data visualizations, I explored key performance metrics across product categories. The analysis focused on uncovering trends in discounting, rating distributions, review volumes, and pricing strategies. Key objectives included identifying high-performing products, understanding rating-review dynamics, and estimating potential revenue contributions.

The project culminated in the creation of an interactive Excel dashboard, providing stakeholders with a clear and actionable view of product performance metrics, category-level insights, and customer engagement trends.
# Data Source
The dataset was sourced through web scraping of Amazon product pages, collecting publicly available information including product details (name, category, price, discount, and ratings) and customer engagement data (review counts, titles, and content). Each record represents a unique product with aggregated reviewer data stored in structured format.
# Tool Used
